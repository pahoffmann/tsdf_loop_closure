## TODO ##

* use globalmap and localmap from fastsense, adapt everything needed
* check the functionality of the globalmap to create a map from file
* start using the maps efficently
* create a method in the localmap, which checks the current intersection of a ray with the localmap
* create a way ( in the localmap ) to read, which part of the globalmap can be seen from a certain position
* read this part
* find a way to display intersections in a nice manner (e.g. some weird weight or a new variable)
