# This file will contain evaluation approaches for the thesis #

## RayTracer vs. Bresenham ##

[ ] Display average runtime difference
[ ] Display average difference in coverage (%)
[ ] make case between coverage and runtime
[ ] explain, why 100% coverage is not possible with any approach
[ ] explain possible solutions for them cells which cannot be covered
    -> removing (a lot might be done with erasing first)
    -> just ignoring


## Hashmaps and Runtime ##

[ ] write about different hashmaps and their runtime
[ ] write, why hashmaps are very important here
[ ] write about solutions and approaches
